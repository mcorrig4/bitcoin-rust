2. **Block validation**: Time-sensitive validation affects network propagation
3. **Memory usage**: UTXO set management requires efficient memory usage
4. **Network I/O**: High-throughput P2P communication

Rust's zero-cost abstractions and lack of garbage collection make it superior for these requirements.

### Security Requirements
As global financial infrastructure, Bitcoin Core requires maximum security:

1. **Memory safety**: Both languages provide this
2. **Type safety**: Rust's type system prevents more error classes
3. **Concurrency safety**: Rust prevents data races at compile time
